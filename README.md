# quadratic-torsion

Code to compute the torsion subgroups that occur over a fixed quadratic field. This accompanies the paper [Torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields and a conjecture of Granville](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14514).

The paper itself explains what parts of this repo are used where. Here we give an overview of the repo according to each folder.

## computations

This contains the meat of our code. Computing positive rank twists is done in the ipython file `positive_rank_twists.ipynb`. The code for curves $$X_1(13)$$
